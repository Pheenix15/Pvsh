HOW PVSH IN PUBLIC WORKS?

This free version of PVSH requires users to publicly declare their commitments, with the understanding that their progress will be monitored by both the community and PVSH itelf. Participants must document their daily journey by making social media posts about their activities or learnings for the day, tagging PVSH and using the hashtag #PVSH. Failure to complete tasks for the day and make the required public post will result in removal from the community.

HOW BET ON YOUR SELF WORKS?

DAILY BET:
After setting a challange goal, participants are provided with a monthly planner calender to mark days they may not be able to perform tasks. The remaining days are used to calculate each participant's agreed bet per day. For instance, if your community decides on a $100 bet per person for the challange and you mark 7 days as inactive, your $4.3 for missing tasks. Completed tasks authomatically add $4.3 to your account, accumulating for future withdrawals at the challenge's end.

BIG BOLD BET:
Similar to the Daily Bet, participants mark inactive days on the monthly planner calender after setting a challenge goal. However, missing a task day results in the complete loss of the initial bet. To recover the lost bet, participants must bet an equvilent amount again. Successful completion of the challenge without missing any more days, your initial lost bet plus the new bet will be paid out to you completely. But in a scenario you miss a second time all your money will be forfited including the old and new bet.
